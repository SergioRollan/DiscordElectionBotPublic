## `/open`
Open an election for voting, specifying the maximum votes per user.

**Example:**

```
- Only admins or users with the configured role can open elections.
- The bot will post the list of candidates and instructions for voting. Each candidate will have a number next to their name.
- In this case, since basketball lineups are made of 5 players, we will want each person to vote for 5 people
